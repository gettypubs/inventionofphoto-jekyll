title: Photographic Portraiture
subtitle:
---

From the excited and vibrant correspondence among Talbot’s friends and
family, it would seem that the invention of photography answered a
long-felt need, and the potential to record human beings was almost
immediately a subject for speculation. Of course, the aristocracy had
always had visual access to its family past through the skills of
portrait painters. In the spring of 1838, Constance Talbot had in fact
been much preoccupied with having the artist and drawing teacher Robert
Forster paint the small Talbot girls (“Ela cannot possibly look better
or more animated than she does at present — so I think this is a
favorable moment for taking her picture”).[^38] Her brother, as she wrote to her
husband in town, “lately had *his* picture painted by Ross the famous
Miniature painter.”[^39] But
portraits of any size were pricey. In the same letter, after Forster was
hired and at work on the portraits, Constance added, somewhat nervously:
“I ought to have told you that Mr. Forster’s charge for children’s
picture is from 2 to 3 guineas each figure.”

Aside from Mr. Forster’s fee, Constance’s greatest concern was for
verisimilitude: the portraits, to be successful, must look like their
subjects. The degree of success obviously depended upon the skills of
the artist. But with the advent of photography, perfect resemblance
seemed at last to be within reach in every portrait. As Talbot himself
reflected: “What would not be the value to our English Nobility of such
a record of their ancestors who lived a century ago? On how small a
portion of their family picture galleries can they really rely with
confidence!”[^40]

A more obvious rhetorical question for the modern reader appears
not to have occurred to Talbot. “What would not be the value” to
*all* people of a “record of their ancestors”? For while
Lacock Abbey, like Buckingham Palace — or, indeed, like Margam Hall, or
Penrice, or Penllergare, all great country estates owned by Talbot’s
extended family — contained its own valuable (if unreliable) records, in
the shape of miniatures, sketches, and oil paintings representing
generations of family forebears, the vast majority of people had never
had access to representations of family likenesses in any form. On the
first page of Dickens’s *Great Expectations* (1861), Pip
tells the reader: “As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw
any likeness of either of them (for their days
were long before the days of photographs), my first fancies regarding
what they were like, were unreasonably derived from their
tombstones.”[^41] The
idea that photography might address the posthumous invisibility of
working people was tantalizing; as the *Edinburgh Review*
noted in 1843, “where the magic names of kindred and home are
inscribed, what a deep interest do the realities of photography
excite!”[^42]

Yet for all its appeal as an idea, portrait photography did not seem
feasible. In 1839 and 1840, photography was expensive and
time-consuming, a pleasant occupation only for those with leisure and
funds to spare; but the process was also unsuited for making portraits
because of the length of time it took to secure an image. Talbot’s
cameras were set up outdoors for thirty to ninety minutes at a stretch,
and the results depended largely on the quality of light, a problem that
the British weather did little to resolve (much of Talbot’s
correspondence makes mention of clouds, overcast skies, and generally
unhelpful conditions; Herschel laments that he didn’t take up
photography while he was in South Africa). Daguerreotypes were similarly
slow to produce, requiring fifteen to thirty minutes under good lighting
conditions. As much as portraiture seemed the next, highly desirable
step in photography’s evolution, it was impossible to keep a living
subject still long enough to produce an effective likeness.[^43]

Desire for portraits, however, inspired experimentation among opticians
and chemists in both America and Europe and indeed largely drove the
rapid innovations that soon changed both Talbot’s and Daguerre’s
processes. By the end of 1839 a first, early mention of success arrived
in a letter from the astronomer and mathematician John William Lubbock
(1803–1865) to Talbot, with the unverified news that “Daguerre has done
a portrait of himself, said to be excellent.”[^44] This would still have been
impossible for Talbot, but by September 1840, perhaps motivated in part
by that report of his rival’s progress, he had a significant
breakthrough, with a refinement in technique that greatly diminished
required exposure times. As Talbot informed readers of the *Literary
Gazette*, “a much better picture can now be obtained in a *minute* than
by the former process in *an hour*. This increased rapidity is
accompanied with an increased sharpness and distinctness in the outlines
of the objects.” On both counts, then — time and clarity of focus —
Talbot’s new calotype process meant that “the art has now reached a
point which is likely to make it extensively useful.” And, he added,
“one of the most important applications of the new process, and most
likely to prove generally interesting, is, undoubtedly, the taking of
portraits. I made trial of it last October, and found that the
experiment readily succeeded. Half a minute appeared to be sufficient in
sunshine, and four or five minutes when a person was seated in the
shade.”[^45]

Daguerreotypists were similarly eager to master portraiture. During the
same month that Talbot managed to reduce exposure times, Antoine Claudet
(1797–1867), a French glassmaker working in London, made progress using
chlorine as well as iodine to increase the light sensitivity of the
copper plates employed in daguerreotypy.[^46] He launched almost immediately into
competition with Richard Beard (1802–1888), a coal merchant and
inventor, who controlled the daguerreotype patent rights in England (for
which he had paid the high sum of eight hundred pounds, an investment
that was to pay off extraordinarily well). Beard had already set up a
partnership with two Americans, Alexander Woolcott and John Johnson (d.
1871), making use of a new American mirror camera that reduced the time
required for a sitting to a more tolerable “one to four minutes.”[^47] Both Beard and Claudet rapidly
opened portrait studios in London — the former in March 1841, and the
latter in June the same year — and competition for customers began.

The subject of portraiture immediately surged to the fore of public
consciousness. Elizabeth Barrett Browning probably spoke for many with
her words to Mary Russell Mitford, who was among the first to have her
picture taken:

> I long to have such a memorial of every being dear to me in the world.
> It is not merely the likeness which is precious in such cases — but
> the association and the sense of nearness involved in the thing … the
> fact of the very shadow of the person lying there fixed forever! It is
> the very sanctification of portraits I think — and it is not at all
> monstrous in me to say … that I would rather have such a memorial of
> one I dearly loved, than the noblest artist’s work ever
> produced.”[^48]

In October 1840 the Edinburgh scientist David Brewster (1781–1868) wrote
with gratitude for some “specimens” Talbot had sent him, but confessed,
“I long for a Portrait.”[^49]
Talbot at once obliged, and Brewster found that the two “very fine”
portraits sent on loan to him as evidence “show what may be expected
from the Art.”[^50]

That “Art” was the appropriate term to describe the calotype seems to
have been the consensus among its earliest enthusiasts. Photograms,
calotypes, and daguerreotypes were frequently described in the early
days as “drawings” or “sketches,” with the meaningful point of reference
being, obviously, painting. Indeed, some of photography’s first admirers
seemed initially to believe that the camera had somehow painted the
image before them. Certainly it was widely held among Talbot’s peers
that the aim of photography was to improve upon painting by imitating
its accomplishment. Photography’s place among the visual arts was later
to be contested, but its earliest practitioners remained profoundly
interested in its aesthetic power. The Reverend George Butler, Talbot’s
old headmaster from his school days at Harrow, begged his former pupil
to turn his invention to work on “drawings of Forest Trees, the oak,
Elm, Beech, &c,” as this would be “the greatest stride towards effective
drawing & painting that has been made for a Century.”[^51] The scientist Sir Charles
Wheatstone (1802–1875), the future inventor of the stereoscope, wrote to
Talbot: “Your new photograph excited much interest at the Marquis’ on
Saturday. The artists generally greatly prefered \[*sic*\] it to the
more elaborately finished Daguerotype \[*sic*\] portraits which were
also exhibited there. One academician said it was equal in effect to any
thing of Sir Joshua’s” \[Reynolds\].[^52]

Photography’s early status as art, however, or as a practice with
artistic potential, was probably due as much to its initial social
context as to its aesthetic accomplishment. It was a diversion for the
well connected, a pursuit with aristocratic and scientific associations.
During the early 1840s those associations were strengthened, no doubt in
part by Queen Victoria’s interest. Photography was, as the Reverend
George Wilson Bridges noted in a letter to Talbot, “certainly an
aristocratic art,” and it looked as if it might remain so, since the
reverend was hardly alone in finding it “rather expensive.”[^53] “Lady Blanche Hyems,” wrote the
humorist Cuthbert Bede,

> assures me that she considers Photography to be *par excellence* the
> scientific amusement of the higher classes… . For the present at any
> rate, Photography has the patronage of aristocratic — may we not add,
> Royal? — amateurs. It has not yet become too common; nor indeed is it

> only people with long purses who can afford to take up Calotyping as

> spare time on their hands who can afford to pay attention to it.[^54]

For all Bede’s satirical tone, he was accurate in his observation that
photography remained not just a cumbersome but a pricey hobby — a fact
that limited its wider use throughout the 1840s, despite Reverend
Bridges’s sentiment that it was, of all the arts, “the most astonishing
of modern times.”[^55]
